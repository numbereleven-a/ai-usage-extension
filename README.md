# AI Usage Tracker: Claude, Codex, Kimi, Cursor, GLM, Qwen

[![CI](https://github.com/cupcakedev/ai-usage-extension/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cupcakedev/ai-usage-extension/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that tracks usage limits from **Claude**, **Codex**,
**MiniMax**, **Kimi Code**, **Cursor**, **Xiaomi MiMo**, the **GLM Coding Plan**
(z.ai), and the **Qwen Coding Plan** (Qwen Cloud), using your existing browser
sessions. It surfaces the data in a popup, an on-page overlay, and the toolbar
badge.

## Features

- **Live limits** for Claude, Codex, MiniMax, Kimi Code, Cursor, Xiaomi MiMo, and the
  GLM and Qwen Coding Plans: percentage used, raw counts, and time to reset when
  exposed by the provider.
- **Toolbar badge** showing your highest current usage at a glance.
- **On-page overlay** on `claude.ai` — a collapsible capsule rendered in a Shadow DOM,
  so it never clashes with the host page's styles.
- **Configurable refresh**: automatic updates every 5 minutes by default, with a
  custom interval of at least 1 minute, or manual updates only via **Refresh**.
- **Limit display**: show the used percentage (13% used) or remaining percentage
  (87% left) across all providers, including the popup, overlays, and badge tooltip.
- **Private by design**: usage is read from your own authenticated browser sessions.
  No extension accounts, no background telemetry.
- **Problem reports**: an optional "Report a problem" button in the popup footer sends
  the message you type — and nothing else until you press Send — to PostHog.

## Install

The extension is not distributed through npm. For normal use, install a packaged
release from the GitHub releases page or load a local build in Chrome.

To load a local build:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` directory.
4. Sign in to the providers you want to track, then open the popup. It refreshes automatically
   by default; in manual mode, press **Refresh**.

Open **Settings** to select **Usage refresh** and set a custom interval in minutes
(fractional values are supported). The interval is saved when you leave the field
or press Enter. **Only on Refresh** removes the background alarm and suppresses
automatic usage requests on worker startup, popup/overlay opening, and credential
changes. Cached data remains visible until you press Refresh. A request already
in progress when you switch modes is allowed to finish.

Under **Popup layout**, **Limit display** switches between **Used** and **Remaining**.
Percentage labels and progress-bar fill follow the selected mode. Warning colors,
badge icon ranges, raw counts, and stored usage calculations still use the consumed
amount.

## Architecture

The extension is split into isolated contexts that communicate through a typed
messaging layer:

```text
src/
  background/   # Service worker: scheduling, fetching, badge updates
    services/   # UsageService — fetches & parses provider APIs
  content/      # claude.ai overlay (React in Shadow DOM) + z.ai token bridge
  welcome/      # First-run onboarding page opened on install
  sidepanel/    # Popup UI (React)
    components/ # Presentational components
    hooks/      # useUsageData — owns the popup's data lifecycle
  shared/       # Cross-context layer — no context-specific imports
    constants  # Storage keys, alarm name, thresholds
    hooks      # Framework hooks shared by popup & overlay (useNow)
    analytics  # Manual problem reports: distinct id, event map, popup -> worker bridge
    messaging  # Typed message helpers (readUsageState, requestUsageRefresh)
    types      # Domain & messaging types
    utils      # clampPercent, getUsageTone, formatReset, formatRelativeTime
```

**Data flow:** the background worker fetches usage, writes a `UsageState` snapshot to
`chrome.storage.local`, and updates the badge. The popup and overlay read that
snapshot and subscribe to `chrome.storage.onChanged`, so every surface stays in sync.
Each provider is saved as soon as its request completes, without waiting for slower
providers. Requests bypass the HTTP cache and time out after 10 seconds; failed
requests retain the last successful snapshot and its original update time.
The worker checks the configured refresh mode whenever it starts and when settings
change: it restores the recurring alarm in automatic mode and clears it in manual
mode. Chrome may delay alarms while the device is asleep.

**Localization:** every user-visible string goes through `msg()`
(`src/shared/i18n.ts`), which reads `public/_locales/<locale>/messages.json`.
All 53 Chrome Web Store languages are translated and the release tests enforce
that they expose the same keys. The one exception is the overlay's "LIMITS"
side tab, which stays in English everywhere by design.

Settings carry a `language` preference: `auto` follows the browser, anything
else loads that `_locales` bundle at startup and feeds it to `msg()` through
`setLocaleMessages`. Because several modules build label tables with `msg()` at
import time, the popup and options entry points apply the language *before*
importing their app; the content script gets the same bundle from the service
worker (`GET_LOCALE_MESSAGES`), which cannot be fetched from a page context.

## Problem reports

The popup footer carries a **Report a problem** button. It opens a dialog, and pressing
Send hands the message to the service worker, which forwards it to PostHog as a single
`problem_reported` event. Nothing is captured automatically: no pageviews, no
autocapture, no exception tracking, no session recording. Alongside the message the
event carries the extension version, browser version, UI language, and which provider
cards are enabled or failing — the context needed to act on the report. The reporter is
identified only by a random UUID generated locally on first use
(`ai_usage_distinct_id` in `chrome.storage.local`).

Reporting is configured through the build environment (see `.env.example`):

```bash
VITE_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN=phc_...
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://eu.i.posthog.com
```

Without a project token the feature stays off and the footer button becomes a plain
link to GitHub issues instead.

In CI the same variables come from the repository settings: add the token as the
`VITE_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` **secret**, and — only if you are not on the EU cloud —
`VITE_POSTHOG_HOST` as a repository **variable**. Both workflows pass them to the build.
Without a token, the release workflow reports a warning and builds with the GitHub
issues link instead of the problem-report dialog.
